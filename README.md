# AdminR Packages

A curated list of R packages created and used by Swiss public institutions


### About

We try to collect and classifly R packages that are are created and used by Swiss statistical offices. This should facilitate colaboration and reduce duplication. We try structure the package list and to present and discuss it on the AdminR Session at the [**Swiss Statistics Meeting 2021**](https://www.statistiktage.ch/en/) on the 6th of Semptember 2021 in Lugano.

Ideally, the listed packages are publicly available, either on CRAN or on GitHub. If this is not possible, an entry should explan how one could get to the package. You may also list interesting packages that are not yet public.
